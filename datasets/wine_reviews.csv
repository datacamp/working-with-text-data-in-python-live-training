Spain,"Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors.

The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances. The result is a young, vigorous wine, dry and balanced in acidity.

Argentina,"Herbal and foresty up front, this Bordeaux blend smells of fig, caramel and berry fruits.

US,"Blended from several stellar vineyard sites, including La Cruz and Devoto, this wine presents a brightness of acidity and crisp, red fruit. These are offset by a heartier uptake of oak and tannin that feels out of place compared to many of the producer's single-vineyard offerings. On the finish, expect tart cranberry and pomegranate to peak.",,87,32.0,California,Sonoma Coast, PINOT NOIR,Zepaltas

US,"Some ageable Cabs are lovely to drink on release. Not this one. It's tough in tannins, with a gum-stinging astringency. Below all that are ripe, concentrated blackberry jam and cassis flavors. Blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's already throwing some sediment, a good sign, which means you won't have to wait 20 years for it to come around. Pop that cork after 2018.",,90,125.0,California,Napa, Cabernet sauvignon,Juslyn Vineyards

US,"Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited.

France,"With grapes from 40-year-old vines, this is a dense and concentrated wine. Yellow fruit as well as crisper citrus flavors give a balance between richness and freshness. It has high alcohol that shows in the light pepper edge although this doesn't detract from the fruitiness of the aftertaste.

It's complex for an unoaked style.",Steelbird Unoaked,88,9.0,California,California,chardonnay,Smoking Loon

US,"The blend is Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. The wine is full-bodied, dry and tannic, and not showing well now, despite a wealth of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, grilled meat and black pepper flavors.

In this case it draws from Monterey County vineyards near the Santa Lucia Highlands and Santa Barbara County vineyard between the Santa Maria Valley and the Sta. Rita Hills.

US,"This rich, hearty and ultimately lovely blend of 82% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot still needs time to open up. When it does, expect dense and pure aromas of blueberry, black currant, graphite and nose-tickling spice.

Drink 2019–2030.",Soul of a Lion,96,150.0,California,Adelaida District,Cabernet sauvignon ,Daou

France,"A hint of caramelized apple clings to the nose, as well as a certain creaminess. The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest. This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed. Savor this slowly. Drink now through 2030.",Osterberg Grand Cru,95,38.0,Alsace,Alsace,riesling ,Cave de Ribeauvillé
US,"This splendid, resonant, beautifully detailed wine captures everything that is most desirable in the 2014 vintage.

Drink now and on through 2026.",Gran Moraine Vineyard,95,45.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot noir ,Aberrant Cellars
US,"It's a shame more producers don't hold their Pinot Noirs back longer, for this bottling from Joe Davis reveals so much depth compared to current releases.

It's all intricately woven by time into something wonderful.",Sierra Madre,95,50.0,California,Santa Maria Valley,pinot noir ,Arcadian
France,"Tight tannins mask the ripe fruit in a wine that is set for long-term aging, so there is a dry core that dominates at the moment.

This is a structured wine that will be ready in 2026.",,95,60.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan, bordeaux-style red blend,Château Malartic-Lagravière
France,"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish. This is lip smacking but has not even started to show itself properly. The finish is clean, stony and lasting. This is one to keep. Drink 2020–2040.",Rangen de Thann Grand Cru,95,50.0,Alsace,Alsace,riesling,Biecher & Schaal
France,This is a powerfully structured wine from a 18-acre property on the plateau of Pomerol. Rich Merlot dominates and gives the wine both its alcohol and its intense tannins and juicy red fruits. The wine is dense with the potential for aging over a considerable time. Drink from 2025.,,95,250.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,Bordeaux-style red blend ,Château Trotanoy
France,"There is something heady about this: a hint of chamomile tincture and pure lemon zest. The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",Engelberg Grand Cru,95,45.0,Alsace,Alsace,RIESLING,Domaine Pfister

Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish.",Year of the Horse Single Vineyard,95,72.0,California,Russian River Valley,pinot noir ,Donum
France,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean.

US,"Vanilla and caramel show right away on the nose of this bottling, followed by stewed blackberry and black plum sauce, proving quite jammy but layered with burnt sugar aromas.

France,"The heady scent of grapefruit and tangelo peel immediately add savoriness to the crisp green-apple fruit that is evident on the nose. But there are also richer hints of honey and yellow apple. The palate remains taut, slender and linear but that tangelo spice is boosted by enticing herbal notes of yarrow and a dollop of yeast.

Australia,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones.

France,"There is something very pure and lifted about this: right now it is so taut that it just says citrus and stone. There is something both ripe and tart, a very lemon-like freshness, with generosity and fruit. There is unusual concentration and for now, while the aromas are still tightly wound, the absolutely stony serious texture is on full display.

Australia,"This is a throwback to those brash, flavor-exuding Aussie wines of the past. Flashy, sweet-scented oak (think maple syrup and toasted coconut) marks the nose, while concentrated cassis and vanilla flavors coat the palate. This is big, but gorgeously so, with velvety-rich tannins and a long, plush finish. No, there's nothing subtle about this blend of 60% Cabernet and 40% Shiraz, but sometimes subtlety is overrated. Drink now–2030.",One,95,95.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,red  blend,Heartland
France,"A lovely heady note of citrus peel and moss hovers above the crisp apple notes of the nose. The bone-dry palate is taut, streaked with absolute lemon freshness and very, very pure. This is linear and totally toned, majoring in the tart and invigorating end of the citrus spectrum. All the more excitement for us. Notions of wet stone pop up and remain on the palate.

The palate adds a stony earthy touch, as well as a hint of lanoline, and has an impressive core of fruit that radiates throughout this wine with pure apple flavor and crisp freshness. This strikes a high soprano note of absolute purity. The body is taut and bone-dry, the finish is clean and lasting. Gorgeous now but totally built to last.

US,"Rounded aromas of melon and salty peaches rise to the nose on this wine from the Monterey County appellation just south of the Santa Lucia Highlands. The palate is driven by citrus, grass and a rather extreme sense of sea salt, enhanced with mouth-watering acidity and a nectarine flesh finish. It's tasty though varietally uncommon.",Thérèse Vineyards Griva Vineyard,88,25.0,California,Arroyo Seco,sauvignon blanc ,Martin Ranch
Italy,"Sangiovese and Merlot grapes are behind this ripe red. It opens with aromas of fleshy black cherry, black currant, blue flowers and oak-driven spice that carry over to the palate together with a mocha note. Grippy tannins provide the backbone.",,88,20.0,Tuscany,Toscana, RED BLEND,Mazzoni
Spain,"Smoky aromas of campfire and clove are blended with high-toned black-fruit scents draped in additional toasty oak. An energetic palate brings its share of resiny, heavy oak, while dark-berry flavors come with woody, toasty, charred accents that suggest clove and black pepper.",PdM Moncayo,88,24.0,Northern Spain,Campo de Borja,syrah ,Pagos del Moncayo
US,"From a trio of vineyards in the appellation, including the producer's estate, this wine has an herbal, feral quality around layers of red berry and dark currant. With big shoulders and a velvety texture, it goes down easily and finishes light.",,88,30.0,California,Carneros,pinot  noir,Schug
US,"Bright, fruity aromas and straightforward cherry and strawberry flavors make this a rather light, fresh wine. It has good balance between the almost-sweet fruit and lively acidity, so it stays appetizing on the second and third sips.",Wiley Vineyard,88,60.0,California,Anderson Valley,pinot  noir,Woodenhead
US,"Very citrusy aromas of fresh squeezed lemons grow rounder with pear and nectarine flesh, all cut by a white rock minerality, without many of the typical grassy notes. The palate is very tight with lime juice and green apples, and driven by chalky grip and vibrant acidity.",Vogelzang Vineyard,88,25.0,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Sauvignon blanc ,Baehner Fournier
US,"This warm-climate Pinot Noir appeals to those who prefer density on the palate. Cranberry and tart cherry dominate on the nose, followed by richer elements of strawberry tart, earth and milk chocolate.",,88,26.0,California,Napa Valley,pinot noir,Ca' Momi
US,"A good effort in a cool vintage, the winery's top cuvée brings tart cranberry and cherry fruit, racy and fresh, along with flavors of stem and herb. The wine spent 11 months in barrel, but shows no significant oak flavors.",Black Family Estate,90,75.0,Oregon,Dundee Hills,pinot noir ,The Four Graces
US,"This elegant wine is dry, balanced in alcohol and classically proportioned. Full-bodied flavors of blackberries, currants and plums lead to a spicy finish. Rich and complex, it shows heightened structure, courtesy perhaps of its Yountville origin. Drink now–2016.",Triere Estate Vineyard,90,30.0,California,Napa Valley, Merlot,Burgess
US,"Bone dry, tart in acidity and seemingly simple, this is the most expensive of Calera's five new Pinot Noirs. It's not showing well now, with tight, mouthwatering cranberry, rosehip tea and tobacco flavors. It feels elegant and silky in the mouth. Give until 2020 in the cellar.",Jensen Vineyard,90,80.0,California,Mt. Harlan, PINOT NOIR,Calera
France,"A strongly wood-aged wine, full of as much spice and toast as fruit. It will probably soften and round out to give a wine that, while firm, will have rich black currant fruitiness, dusty tannins and fresh acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.",,90,45.0,Bordeaux,Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux-style red blend,Château Balac
France,"Recognized for its good value, Saint-Romain is particularly strong on white wines. This wine, from old vines, shows some concentration and rich fruits that are balanced by toast flavors. It is a ripe wine with a strongly refreshing feel at the end.",Vieilles Vignes,89,50.0,Burgundy,Saint-Romain, Chardonnay,Domaine de Bellene
US,"The blackberry, black currant, cassis and licorice flavors on this wine are strong, ripe and complex, and a rich coating of oak brings toast and vanilla notes. But the wine, which is a blend based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, is so tannic that it's hard to appreciate now. Give it until 2019 to come around.",The Rescue,89,80.0,California,Napa Valley,bordeaux-style red blend,Juslyn Vineyards
US,"This new offering is light and elegant, with tart fruit flavors of rhubarb and pomegranate. There's an herbal edge to the wine, all in proportion, with generous acidity that could reward a few more years in the bottle.",Le Pré du Col Vineyard,89,60.0,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,PINOT NOIR ,Bergström
France,"Close to Gaillac, this vineyard has a Mediterranean feel to it, making it good for Syrah. The wine is rich, softly textured, aromatic and smooth. Wood aging gives a rich texture that partners the full black fruits. It will age relatively quickly, so drink from 2016.",Mas des Merveilles,89,40.0,Southwest France,Côtes du Lot,Syrah,Château Lagrézette
France,"The top wine from this château is a solid, textured effort. It has a full-bodied feel with very ripe black fruits.

US,"The winery's Chards always show the attractive opulence of their warm origin. While this wine is from the difficult 2011 vintage, the wine still manages to wrest plenty of tropical fruit and peach fruit flavors. Oak provides the buttered toast and vanilla, while the acidity is mouthwatering. Drink up.",,89,42.0,California,Alexander Valley,CHARDONNAY,Robert Young
US,"The tannins are strong and the blackberry, currant and oak flavors have an earthy, herbaceous tug. Instead of flamboyance, it shows precision and control, but those tannins make it too astringent to enjoy now. It will age easily until 2020; 2024 is not a stretch. Another ten years is, but you never know with a wine this dry and balanced.",,89,68.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet  sauvignon,Saddleback

Drink 2015–2020.",Perceptum,89,30.0,Tuscany,Toscana, Red blend,Tenuta Santo Pietro
US,"Raspberry flavors are front and center in this young, light wine. It keeps the tart acids in proportion, and the palate is focused and well defined. The finish turns hard and tannic, but further bottle age should soften it up a bit.",,89,20.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley, PINOT NOIR,Swick
US,"A silky texture without much tannin, and vivid fruit flavors combine for a smooth and satisfying wine. It smells like fresh berries and cherries, and tastes on the light side as the fruit nuances mingle. Medium bodied, this is a pleasure to drink now.

US,"Sandalwood, hibiscus and grapeseed aromas converge on the nose of this wine that comes from a vineyard just west of the Sta. Rita Hills.

US,"Impressively dry, medium bodied, very firmly tannic and showing complex fruit flavors, this Zinfandel-based wine needs time to mellow. It smells like fresh raspberries and blackberries, and tastes concentrated and mouthcoating, while the astringent tannins hold everything back just a bit. It contains 34% Syrah and 21% Petite Sirah, and will be best after 2018.",Coro Mendocino,89,40.0,California,Mendocino,Red blend ,Golden
France,"Soft and round, this ripe wine offers both fruit and acidity. It is young and full of green plum and pear flavors, still textured with a young, crisp character.

Dusty, tongue-coating tannins keep the palate grounded.",The Hundreth Monkey,87,50.0,Colorado,Grand Valley,red blend ,The Infinite Monkey Theorem

Spain,"The nose on this multigrape blend is gaseous, with forceful berry aromas but little nuance. A tannic, rubbery, rock-hard palate is home to candied black-fruit flavors that are a touch green at the core. Mint and licorice flavors confirm an herbal presence on a brutally tannic finish.",,87,23.0,Catalonia,Montsant,RED BLEND ,Faunus
Spain,"This unique Rioja dessert wine can't be judged against anything but itself. It's rusty in color, with aromas of horsehide, sweaty saddle and exotic fruits. The palate is coarse but staunch, while the flavor profile starts with brine and ends with more familiar caramel and toffee. A sweet, syrupy finish is as challenging as it is flavorful. This is a breed unto its own. Drink now.",Colección Vivanco Dulce de Invierno 4 Varietales,87,52.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,Red  blend,Dinastía Vivanco
US,"Quiet notes of smoked meat, flowers and toast lead on the nose of this blend of 60% Petit Verdot and 40% Syrah. Traces of mint and blackberry fill in the backdrop.

US,"From Yountville, this 100% Cab is austere and lean on the nose, still closed somewhat, a waft here and there of herb and green pepper balanced by hearty black fruit and a taste of black tea. Since it's grippy on the palate, decant the wine and let it open awhile before enjoying.",Mast Ranch,87,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet sauvignon,Laird

US,"La Casita is all clone 114 and 50% whole-cluster fermented. In a year with many wines showing minimal ripeness, this breaks the mold. The forward strawberry fruit hints at sugary sweetness.

France,"Apple, lemon oil and vinosity unite to such a degree that the nose is completely heady: here is a Riesling at the very cusp of maturity, a trajectory that has only just begun. The dry palate also reveals hints of lanolin and peach but is utterly governed by lemon freshness. This is sleek and taut, and gives you a glimpse of what mature dry Riesling can be: incisive, complex but eternally fresh. The finish is utterly clean. Drink now through 2030.",Mambourg Grand Cru,94,26.0,Alsace,Alsace,RIESLING,Domaine Michel Fonne
France,A subtle nose hints softly at lemon and crisp green apple. The palate comes in with absolutely pure streaks of lemon and stone. This is taut and uncompromising and speaks authentically of stone and citrus fruit with a promise of riper apple in the future. This needs time to come into its own and has all the concentration and juiciness it needs for cellar age. This is dry and will drink well 2020–2035.,Engelberg Grand Cru,94,45.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Pfister
US,"The defining characteristic of Carter seems to be a taste of steel or gun metal running through the spine. It's here again, with compact fruit and drying tannins. That fruit has a dark core, and it's polished and textural, with lightly herbal highlights. This is a wine to track in the cellar over the next decade or longer.",Carter Vineyard,94,63.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot  noir,Ken Wright
France,"A lovely purity of lemon oil and zest pervades both nose and palate of this straight-laced wine. There is purity and freshness, precision and tons of zesty tangy lemon.

Drink now through 2030.",Brand Grand Cru Clos de la Treille,94,32.0,Alsace,Alsace,RIESLING,Francois Baur
France,"A herbal touch of crushed lemon balm and apple peel makes for an intriguing, inviting nose. The palate adds fresh apple notes to these subtle herb notes and remains totally juicy and lively.

US,"Planted in 2006 to heirloom clones, most of them Pommard, this is a concentrated, tannic wine that needs time in bottle to develop. For now, expect rose and raspberry, with a depth of black cherry compote—flavors that are immediately inviting and richly layered. Yet, it will tell more of its story down the road. Allow it to open now or cellar through 2029.",Harper's Rest Estate Grown,94,90.0,California,Russian River Valley,PINOT NOIR,Arista
France,"It is the tart-ripe contrast of tangerine and ripe lemon that makes both nose and palate so enticing. The purity of flavors and this appealing contrast carry right through on the taut, bright, linear and dry palate. Its texture seems stony and profound.

It's balanced and forgiving, its supple texture yielding to a creaminess on the finish that's irresistible.",Klopp Ranch,94,66.0,California,Russian River Valley, pinot noir,Merry Edwards
US,"This plump Pinot Noir uses 20% new French oak to deliver nutmeg, gingerbread spice and licorice aromas. Black cherry and raspberry round out the nose and integrate on the palate, which is hearty and rich in Christmas spice and crushed rock notes. An excellent choice for anyone seeking a full-figured Pinot.",La Encantada Vineyard,94,40.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills, pinot noir,Mollie
US,"Sharp lime and pithy grapefruit notes accented by sour cream, chalk and limestone lead the nose of this wine from the pioneering Talley family.

France,"This is a small, 10-acre property, owned by the Moueix family, at the heart of the Pomerol plateau. With its 30% Cabernet Franc it is perfumed and ripe, giving delicious black fruits as well as a firmer structure. The wine is set for a long aging with great potential. Drink from 2024.",,94,130.0,Bordeaux,Pomerol,Bordeaux-style red blend,Château Hosanna
France,"The nose is reminiscent of the yellow and aromatic peel of ripe apples. It even has a touch of mirabelle. The palate continues in the same fruit-driven vein with that pure, ripe but tart apple note that seems to be such a feature of Alsace Riesling. The palate is dry and has a fine-boned structure that almost crunches in the mouth. A pure lemon note makes for a very clean-cut finish.",Moenchberg Grand Cru,94,53.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Gresser
France,"Earth, apple and citrus align on the nose. The palate brings out more earthiness but also pits the notions of mellow baked apple against absolutely tart lemon freshness. Stone and earth cling constantly to these flavors and draw you in. The palate is pure and slender, totally dry and taut. The finish is of lasting lemon zest. This needs time but is full of promise. Drink 2020–2035.",Altenberg de Bergbieten Grand Cru,94,33.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling ,Domaine Roland Schmitt
US,"Tingly acidity complements the lush, full-bodied concentration of this estate-grown beauty. It's both soft and sensual in tone. Pine, orange peel and pomegranate notes play against the richness and add freshness to the chewy tannin. Best enjoyed 2024 through 2034.",Year of the Horse West Slope Single Vineyard,94,90.0,California,Carneros,pinot  noir,Donum
France,"This is a tightly coiled wine, still firm and packed with tannins as well as fruit. It has a strong dry core that is lifted by the bright acidity. This is going to be a very complete wine, all the elements well in place. Drink from 2026.",,94,35.0,Bordeaux,Pessac-Léognan, bordeaux-style red blend,Château Olivier
France,"This rich wine has a good proportion (31%) of Cabernet Franc to give it a perfumed structured character. It is dense and with considerable tannins at this stage. By contrast, the fruit has enormous potential with rich blackberry and black-plum flavors. This chateau has made a considerable stride in this vintage. Drink from 2022.",,94,91.0,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,bordeaux-style red blend,Château Quintus
France,"A pure startling cherry note rises from the glass. It is flanked by notes of autumn forest, tar and dried orange rind. Evidently, there is some development and evolution here. The palate is alive and fills not only the mouth but all the senses with its alluring aromas, yet it is firmly anchored in earthier tones. The body is svelte and fresh: its fine-boned structure is as much down to fresh acidity as it is to finely flexed tannins. This is profound, lasting and delicious but also deliciously light.",Grossi Laüe Limited Edition,94,55.0,Alsace,Alsace,Pinot noir,Hugel
France,"Glorious apple freshness jumps from the glass, there is the slightest touch of honey, too. On the palate, the apple notions persist: there is fresh and baked apple, adding both crisp and mellow notes. Everything is brightened by lemony freshness on a concentrated but elegant and balanced body. Flavors last and have a long, clean and bone-dry finish. This is good enough to go the mileage. Drink now through 2030.",Schlossberg Grand Cru,94,54.0,Alsace,Alsace,RIESLING ,Jean-Baptiste Adam
France,"Produced from 25-year-old vines in a six-acre parcel, this is a soft, ripe, red-fruit-flavored wine. Wood aging is noticeable in the smoky character of the wine and the ripe tannins. Otherwise, the juicy, fresh fruit dominates. Drink from 2017.",Les Celliers de la Pauline,89,28.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,pinot noir ,Eric Louis
US,"Lavish on the nose, this wine, made by a blind classical pianist, shows aromas of blackcurrant, caramel and hickory smoke. The heavy smoke on the nose fades away once sipped, and the palate proves quite grippy and tightly wound, showing tar, black pepper, teriyaki, black plum and cocoa-dust flavors.",Bon Vivant Destiny Vineyards Derek Heights Selection,89,45.0,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet sauvignon,Hunt Cellars
US,"A straightforward, modern dry Riesling, this wine shows a slight hint of gasoline, citrus blossoms, wet river stones and apple skin on the nose. The mouthfeel is more full than Mike Callahan's other bottlings, with waxy citrus skins, lime pith, sour apple, alkaline elements and a touch of white jasmine.",Coast View Vineyard,89,22.0,California,Monterey County, riesling,MaidenStoen
Canada,"Cherry and plum, chocolate and peppery herbs combine here in a well-structured wine with some years of life ahead.

US,"Soy, black fruit and asphalt aromas are strong on the nose of this wine by the Four Sisters project. The palate is varietally pure, with black pepper, tar and boysenberry. It dives a bit deeper as well, showing coffee and dark chocolate character.",Private Reserve,89,24.0,California,Paso Robles,syrah ,Serena's Vineyard
US,"Austere, this needs time in the glass to unwind and develop into the full-bodied, more exuberant wine it becomes, a mix of cedar, thyme and leather. At first unpenetrable, the tannin softens into smooth layers of black plum and pepper.",,89,38.0,California,Napa Valley,CABERNET  SAUVIGNON,Renteria

US,"This full-bodied, concentrated wine is dry, quite firm and tannic in texture. It smells rich and a bit earthy, and tastes like blackberries, cranberries and beef. The style will accompany rich, meaty food very well.",,86,15.0,California,California,cabernet  sauvignon,Josh Cellars

France,"This wine comes from Château le Gardera on the slopes above the Garonne river in the Entre-deux-Mers region. It's a big, wood-aged and spicy wine that's full of attractive red berry fruits.

Give this a few more years of bottle age.",Parker's,87,42.0,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,pinot noir ,Melrose
US,"Squeezed lemon rinds and a faint whiff of petrol show on an otherwise reluctant nose from this off-dry wine.

US,"Joseph Jewell's 2014s from remote Humboldt County are dazzling. The color off this wine is on the light side, and so are the raspberry, tea leaf and cinnamon flavors, but they make for a pleasant, harmonious combination.

The hand-harvested 65% Merlot and 35% Cabernet Franc blend has both firm tannins and the promise of ripe fruits, black berries and a rich, opulent character.

The variety gets lost with the herbal notes taking over, but it still offers enjoyment.",Sonas,85,25.0,Washington,Yakima Valley,merlot,OS Winery
France,"Firm, dry tannins behind this wine give a hard edge that will need time. The wine is powered by its structure, solid and only just fruity.

US,"This reserve-level cuvée spent eight months in 55% new French oak, and can benefit from additional bottle age.

The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.",,88,35.0,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,pinot noir,Drouhin Oregon Roserock
France,"This is a rich, soft wine with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. The acidity will hold the wine together and allow it to age. A mineral edge comes from the caillou (stones) in the soil—hence the wine's name. It will age, although quickly, so drink from 2018.",Les Cailles Premier Cru,88,70.0,Burgundy,Nuits-St.-Georges,PINOT  NOIR,Labouré-Roi

The palate is dry and finishes very clean, leaving you with haunting apple notes and fresh lemon.",Kirchberg de Barr Grand Cru,93,38.0,Alsace,Alsace,Riesling,Domaine Vincent Stoeffler
France,"The gentlest floral hint is suggested on the nose. The palate, on the other hand, broods and does not want to let go of its flavors. The dry palate is stony, textured and clean but it does not yet let any fruit speak. There is real concentration and length, but it clearly is too early to enjoy this. The finish gives a suggestion of apple, but we had better wait. Drink 2020–2030.",Rosacker Grand Cru,93,35.0,Alsace,Alsace,riesling,Biecher & Schaal

Underneath sits a very sprightly, very fresh wine that pits fruity apple mellowness against total, dry freshness.

France,"This estate, dating to the 18th century and close to the Gironde estuary, has produced a rich wine. Young tannins and fine fruity acidity are both present in a wine that is serious and dense.

Consistent from vintage to vintage is the elegance and depth of detail, beginning with subtle, entwined fruit flavors of raspberry and cherry.

Italy,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese has a rather inexpressive nose that eventually reveals bell pepper, cedar and spice. The palate offers dried black cherries, oak, sawdust and oak-driven spice while astringent wood tannins give it an abrupt, drying finish.

US,"This winery is at the extreme edge of the pick-early, low-alcohol movement, which can make the wines challenging for the usual California Pinot fan. But this Pinot begins on familar territory, with heady aromas of dried violet and scarlet rose, damp forest floor, and cinnamon-laced cranberry sauce, managing to be both brisk and funky.

The two varieties somewhat seem to cancel each other out initially, with aromas of smoked meat, cherry, herb and earth that don't seem fully resolved.

France,"From the cool east face of the vineyard, this is crisp and tight, less opulent than some Corton-Charlemagne.

Drink from 2017.",,88,15.0,Bordeaux,Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux,BORDEAUX-STYLE RED BLEND ,Château Peyredoulle
France,"The wine is all fruit initially and then the firmer tannins kick in. It has a strongly tannic core that leaves the wine dry and tough after 12 months in barrel.

US,"Roughly half and half Stermer Vineyard and Meyer Vineyard fruit is selected for this reserve blend. It's a deep-diving wine that pushes precise flavors of black cherry, licorice, vanilla and espresso front and center.

The silky, weightless palate delivers concentrated black cherry, blackberry, mineral and Asian spice alongside silky, smooth tannins. The smoky notes are unusual, and originate from a fire that raged near the vineyards in 2012, but nonetheless add to the wine's depth and character.",Franchetti,92,149.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Terre Siciliane,RED  BLEND,Passopisciaro
US,"Co-fermented with about 2% Viognier, this aromatic Syrah offers a bouquet of floral, citrus and berry scents. It's clean, focused and pure, not fleshy but concentrated.

US,"There is a deeply sanguine sense to the nose of this appellation blend by the Buellton-based winery, with bloody meats and graphite giving way to ripe raspberry fruit, brown spices and chopped herbs. It's very spicy once sipped, with black pepper, mocha and red fruits upholding more iron and pencil-shaving flavors on the palate.",,92,44.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Pinot  noir,Dragonette
US,"Soft and ultra-smooth, this is crafted in a drink-now style that holds considerable appeal. Lightly spiced purple fruits are in place, and a hint of a vegetal note is almost invisible.

US,"This wine is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with tiny additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. A minty, menthol streak is strong on the nose, veering into almost eucalyptus, while dried herb and a shot of gunpowder provide additional savory aromas and flavors.

Best after 2018.",,88,25.0,California,Solano County,Syrah,Rock Wren

US,"One of the winery's tasty bottlings that are odes to Bill Foley's Texas ranch roots, this offers aromas of crushed chalk, fresh apple blossoms and a ruby-red grapefruit peel tartness.
